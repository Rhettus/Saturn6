## Known issues:

- The RPi holders that fit the PoE & NVMe hat block off USB power port. Not an issue for me
- The width of the RPi holders is too wide to fit the threaded screw between the extrusions. Need to trim a couple of mm off each holder and redo the ears. I assembled in the rack.


Work in progress
